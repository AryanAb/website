## Introduction

In this blog post, I will be going through the steps to create an animation for the double pendulum problem.
The final result should look something like above. I will be using JavaScript and p5.js through out this post.
We will first look at some of the basic physics behind the system, then how to numerically solve it, and finally
how to draw it.

## The Physics

For a general double pendulum proble, the physics could get surprisingly complicated. For the sake of simplicity then,
let's make some assumptions. Assume that the connections to the pendulums are unfiorm rigid bodies of equal length $l$
and equal mass $m$. Let $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ be the angles that that the first and second rod make with the top of
the page respectively. Let $p_1$ and $p_2$ be the linear momentum of the first and second rod respectively.

Attempting to solve this system using Newtonian mechanics would be foolish. Insead, we make use of Lagrangian mechanics.
In Lagrangian mechanics there is the concept of Lagrangian, which is the difference between the kinetic and potential
energy:
$$
L = T - U.
$$
Using this we can get Lagrange equations of motion:
$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i} = 0
$$
where $x_i$ is a basis vector in our coordinate system and $\dot{x}_i = dx_i/dt$, a notation that we will keep using. I have not given any reason for why any of this is true.
If you are interested in the derivation and a more in depth explenation, you can read chapters 6 and 7 of
_Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems_ by Marion and Thornton.

Using the above information, we can find a relation for each pendulum. I will skip the math work here, but you can check
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum#Lagrangian) to see how it's done. We end up with a system
of 4 ordinary differential equations with 4 functions.
$$
\dot{\theta_1} = \frac{6(2p_1 - 3\cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2)p_2)}{ml^2(16 - 9\cos^2(\theta_1 - \theta_2))}
$$
$$
\dot{\theta_2} = \frac{6(8p_2 - 3\cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2)p_1)}{ml^2(16 - 9\cos^2(\theta_1 - \theta_2))}
$$
$$
\dot{p}_1 = \frac{-1}{2}ml^2(\dot{\theta}_1\dot{\theta}_2\sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2) + 3\frac{g}{l}\sin \theta_1)
$$
$$
\dot{p}_2 = \frac{-1}{2}ml^2(-\dot{\theta}_1\dot{\theta}_2\sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2) + \frac{g}{l}\sin \theta_2)
$$
It turns out that there is no way to analytically solve this system of ODEs. However, we can still use a numerical method.

## RK4 Method

The Runge-Kutta methods are a family of methods to solve ordinary differential equations. Here, we will use the Runge-Kutta
method of order 4, also known as RK4. Let's see how RK4 method actually works before we try to implement it.

Let $y(t)$ be a once differentiable function. Then define $f(t, y(t)) = y'(t)$. Let $h$ be our step size. This is the
amount that $t$ goes forward to approximate the behaviour of $y$. We adopt the notation that $t_n$ is our $n$-th step
and $y_t \approx y(t)$. With all the defininitions and notations out of the way, we can now express what the method
actually does.

We first move an amount $k_1$ in the $y$ direction based on the current slope. Then, we take the slope at halfway point
between where the current step, and where the next step would be if we moved $k_1$ to get a slope $k_2$. We would
repeat the same process this time with $k_2$ to get $k_3$. Finally we take a full step, and get the value of slope
at the end point to get $k_4$. Then a linear combination of $k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$, and $k_4$ would give us an approximation
for the next point. This process has a step error of $O(h^4)$, which is not bad at all. The steps are as follows:
$$
k_1 = h \cdot f(t_n, y_n)
$$
$$
k_2 = h \cdot f(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{k_1}{2})
$$
$$
k_3 = h \cdot f(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{k_2}{2})
$$
$$
k_4 = f(t_n + h, y_n + k_3)
$$
$$
y_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
$$
Now the question is how to extend this to a system of ODEs. Let's consider our system of equations. $\dot{\theta}_1$
and $\dot{\theta}_2$ depend on the values $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, $p_1$, and $p_2$. $\dot{p}_1$ and $\dot{p}_2$ depend
on $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, $\dot{\theta}_1$, and $\dot{\theta}_2$, the latter of which depend on $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, 
$p_1$, and $p_2$ as we saw. Therefore, all four of these equations can be represented as functions with the same 4
arguments.
$$
\dot{\theta}_1 = f(\theta_1, \theta_2, p_1, p_2)
$$
$$
\dot{\theta}_2 = g(\theta_1, \theta_2, p_1, p_2)
$$
$$
\dot{p}_1 = j(\theta_1, \theta_2, p_1, p_2)
$$
$$
\dot{p}_2 = k(\theta_1, \theta_2, p_1, p_2)
$$
Now, assuming the initial conditions are known, we have all the information to do the first step of RK4 on all of these.
$$
k_1 = h \cdot f(\theta_1, \theta_2, p_1, p_2)
$$
$$
l_1 = h \cdot g(\theta_1, \theta_2, p_1, p_2)
$$
$$
m_1 = h \cdot j(\theta_1, \theta_2, p_1, p_2)
$$
$$
n_1 = h \cdot k(\theta_1, \theta_2, p_1, p_2)
$$
What can we do for the second step? Well, the variable $\theta_1$ has moved $k_1$ amount, $\theta_2$ has moved $l_1$
amount, and so on. We can now see where the halfway point would be for each of these variables:
$$
k_2 = h \cdot f(\theta_1 + \frac{k_1}{2}, \theta_2 + \frac{l_1}{2}, p_1 + \frac{m_1}{2}, p_2 + \frac{n_1}{2})
$$
$$
l_2 = h \cdot g(\theta_1 + \frac{k_1}{2}, \theta_2 + \frac{l_1}{2}, p_1 + \frac{m_1}{2}, p_2 + \frac{n_1}{2})
$$
$$
m_2 = h \cdot j(\theta_1 + \frac{k_1}{2}, \theta_2 + \frac{l_1}{2}, p_1 + \frac{m_1}{2}, p_2 + \frac{n_1}{2})
$$
$$
n_2 = h \cdot k(\theta_1 + \frac{k_1}{2}, \theta_2 + \frac{l_1}{2}, p_1 + \frac{m_1}{2}, p_2 + \frac{n_1}{2})
$$
As you might guess, the other steps follow similarly.
$$
k_3 = h \cdot f(\theta_1 + \frac{k_2}{2}, \theta_2 + \frac{l_2}{2}, p_1 + \frac{m_2}{2}, p_2 + \frac{n_2}{2})
$$
$$
l_3 = h \cdot g(\theta_1 + \frac{k_2}{2}, \theta_2 + \frac{l_2}{2}, p_1 + \frac{m_2}{2}, p_2 + \frac{n_2}{2})
$$
$$
m_3 = h \cdot j(\theta_1 + \frac{k_2}{2}, \theta_2 + \frac{l_2}{2}, p_1 + \frac{m_2}{2}, p_2 + \frac{n_2}{2})
$$
$$
n_3 = h \cdot k(\theta_1 + \frac{k_2}{2}, \theta_2 + \frac{l_2}{2}, p_1 + \frac{m_2}{2}, p_2 + \frac{n_2}{2})
$$

$$
k_4 = h \cdot f(\theta_1 + k_3, \theta_2 + l_3, p_1 + m_3, p_2 + n_3)
$$
$$
l_4 = h \cdot g(\theta_1 + k_3, \theta_2 + l_3, p_1 + m_3, p_2 +  n_3)
$$
$$
m_4 = h \cdot j(\theta_1 + k_3, \theta_2 + l_3, p_1 + m_3, p_2 +  n_3)
$$
$$
n_4 = h \cdot k(\theta_1 + k_3, \theta_2 + l_3, p_1 + m_3, p_2 +  n_3)
$$
We will show the new values for each of the variables with a prime symbol.
$$
\theta'_1 = \theta_1 + \frac{1}{6}(k_0 + 2k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3)
$$
$$
\theta'_2 = \theta_2 + \frac{1}{6}(l_0 + 2l_1 + 2l_2 + 2l_3)
$$
$$
p'_1 = p_1 + \frac{1}{6}(m_0 + 2m_1 + 2m_2 + 2m_3)
$$
$$
p'_2 = p_2 + \frac{1}{6}(n_0 + 2n_1 + 2n_2 + 2n_3)
$$

With a numerical algorithm at our disposal, we can write a program to solve this system for us. First, we will define
the constants that we will be using.

```js
const m = 1; // mass of the rods
const l = 60; // length of the rods
const gr = -9.81; // Earth's gravitational acceleration
```

Now, let's make the functions $f$, $g$, $j$, and $k$.

```js
function f(t1, t2, p1, p2) {
	return 6/(m*l*l) * (2 * p1 - 3*Math.cos(t1 - t2) * p2)/(16 - 9*Math.cos(t1 - t2)*Math.cos(t1 - t2));
}

function g(t1, t2, p1, p2) {
	return 6/(m*l*l) * (8 * p2 - 3*Math.cos(t1 - t2) * p1)/(16 - 9*Math.cos(t1 - t2)*Math.cos(t1 - t2));
}

function j(t1, t2, p1, p2) {
	return -0.5*m*l*l * (f(t1, t2, p1, p2)*g(t1, t2, p1, p2)*Math.sin(t1 - t2) + 3*gr/l*Math.sin(t1));
}

function k(t1, t2, p1, p2) {
	return -0.5*m*l*l * (-1*f(t1, t2, p1, p2)*g(t1, t2, p1, p2)*Math.sin(t1 - t2) + gr/l*Math.sin(t2));
}
```

The next step is to create our RK4 method function. This function will take 4 inputs: $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, $p_1$, and $p_2$.
It will then do the computation explained above and return 4 outputs, the new values for $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, $p_1$,
and $p_2$ after taking a step $h$. To do this, we can make the function take an array of 4 values as an input, and then
return an array of 4 values at the end. This way, we can directly feed the functions output back to it as input and get
points at farther steps.

```js
// inits is an array of [t1, t2, p1, p2] each one having some initial condition value
function RK4(inits) {
	const t1 = inits[0];
	const t2 = inits[1];
	const p1 = inits[2];
	const p2 = inits[3];

	const h = 0.08;

	const k0 = h*f(t1, t2, p1, p2);
	const l0 = h*g(t1, t2, p1, p2);
	const m0 = h*j(t1, t2, p1, p2);
	const n0 = h*k(t1, t2, p1, p2);

	const k1 = h*f(t1 + 0.5*k0, t2 + 0.5*l0, p1 + 0.5*m0, p2 + 0.5*n0);
	const l1 = h*g(t1 + 0.5*k0, t2 + 0.5*l0, p1 + 0.5*m0, p2 + 0.5*n0);
	const m1 = h*j(t1 + 0.5*k0, t2 + 0.5*l0, p1 + 0.5*m0, p2 + 0.5*n0);
	const n1 = h*k(t1 + 0.5*k0, t2 + 0.5*l0, p1 + 0.5*m0, p2 + 0.5*n0);

	const k2 = h*f(t1 + 0.5*k1, t2 + 0.5*l1, p1 + 0.5*m1, p2 + 0.5*n1);
	const l2 = h*g(t1 + 0.5*k1, t2 + 0.5*l1, p1 + 0.5*m1, p2 + 0.5*n1);
	const m2 = h*j(t1 + 0.5*k1, t2 + 0.5*l1, p1 + 0.5*m1, p2 + 0.5*n1);
	const n2 = h*k(t1 + 0.5*k1, t2 + 0.5*l1, p1 + 0.5*m1, p2 + 0.5*n1);

	const k3 = h*f(t1 + k2, t2 + l2, p1 + m2, p2 + n2);
	const l3 = h*g(t1 + k2, t2 + l2, p1 + m2, p2 + n2);
	const m3 = h*j(t1 + k2, t2 + l2, p1 + m2, p2 + n2);
	const n3 = h*k(t1 + k2, t2 + l2, p1 + m2, p2 + n2);

	// new values nt1, nt2, np1, and np2
	const nt1 = t1 + 1/6 * (k0 + 2*k1 + 2*k2 + k3);
	const nt2 = t2 + 1/6 * (l0 + 2*l1 + 2*l2 + l3);
	const np1 = p1 + 1/6 * (m0 + 2*m1 + 2*m2 + m3);
	const np2 = p2 + 1/6 * (n0 + 2*n1 + 2*n2 + n3);

	return [nt1, nt2, np1, np2];
}
```
We now have our code to solve the system of ODEs. The next step is to draw the solution.

## Drawing

To draw the double pendulums (or two rods really in our simplified case) we will use the p5.js library. Let's create an
`index.html` file. Add,
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
		<title>Double Pendulum</title>
		<style>
			body {
				padding: 0;
				margin: 0;
			}
		</style>
		<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.4.1/p5.min.js"></script>
		<script src="sketch.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
```
Now, create a `sketch.js` file. In this file we will add the code to draw the pendulums. The setup is just initializing
the canvas:
```js
function setup() {
	createCanvas(400, 400);
}
```
The `draw` function is the function that is called every frame and draws on the canvas. There are 4 things to draw: First
pendulum, second pendulum, line connecting the origin to the first pendulum, and the line connecting the first pendulum to
the second pendulum. Note that the velocity dictating the behaviour of our pendulums comes from our RK4 method. So we need
to call that first.

For initial conditions, let's say that our pendulums both start fully horizontal. That is, $\theta_1 = \frac{\pi}{2}$
and $\theta_2 = \frac{\pi}{2}$. Then,
```js
let inits = [Math.PI/2, Math.PI/2, 0, 0];

function draw() {
	background(220);

	inits = RK4(inits);
	const t1 = inits[0];
	const t2 = inits[1];

	// using trigonometry to convert angles to cartesian coordinates
	// offset 200 to put the origin in middle of the canvas
	let x1 = l * Math.sin(t1) + 200;
	let y1 = -l * Math.cos(t1) + 200;
	
	let x2 = l * Math.sin(t2) + x1;
	let y2 = -l * Math.cos(t2) + x2;

	// draw the line from origin to the first pendulum
	line(200, 200, x1, y1);
	// draw the first pendulum
	fill(color(255, 0, 0));
	circle(x1, y1, 10);
	// draw the line from first pendulum to the second pendulum
	line(x1, y1, x2, y2);
	// draw the second pendulum
	fill(color(0, 0, 255));
	circle(x2, y2, 10);
}
```

And now you have a double pendulum system. You can also add traces, like the ones on the screen. You can see the full code
for that on my [GitHub](https://github.com/AryanAb/DoublePendulum).

## Closing Notes

There are so many fun experiments that you can do with this. If you want a physics exercise, you can solve this for the
general case when the masses and lengths are different. Or you can add a third pendulum and solve the Lagrangian for that.
If you want some fun with numerical computation, you can replace RK4 method with other ways of solving ODEs numerically,
and put them next to each other (planning to do that next myself!). The possibilities are endless. Pick one, and have fun.
