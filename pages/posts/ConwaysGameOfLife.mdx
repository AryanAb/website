## Explanation

This post just demonstrates a simple P5.js widget for 
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). If this simulation gets to a stable
state or you are board, you could just refresh the page to see another simulation starting from a random state. 
There are already many great discussions and guides on Conway's Game of Life available online, 
so you could check them out.

If you are curious to see my implementation of it, my code is available on my 
[GitHub](https://github.com/AryanAb/conway-game-of-life). That version also gives you the ability to edit the grid
by clicking on the cells.
