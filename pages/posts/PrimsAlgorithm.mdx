## Introduction

Prim's algorithm is another algorithm that could be used to generate mazes. Its end result does not look as random
as recursive backtracking, but it's worth looking into how the algorithm works.

Once again, you should check out
Jamis's [post](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/10/maze-generation-prim-s-algorithm) if you want to read more.

Like the previous post in the series, we will see how to implement the algorithm in Python and will use the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library
to actually draw the maze. Here is an example of the final output:

![Example of a maze made using recursive backtracking](/images/prims.png "Example of a Maze made using recursive backtracking")

## Explenation

In recursive backtracking, we saw that we can choose an initial path, and then continuously carve a path to generate
a maze. This method of creating a maze works, but we have limitations on the size of the maze that we can create though
to the sheer number of recursive calls.

Prim's algorithm is an alternative way of creating mazes. This method does not rely on any recursion, and thus enables
us to generate larger mazes without having to worry about the memory. The tradeoff of this approach is that some mazes
will look less random.

Similar to recursive backtracking, Prim's also starts by selecting a random cell, and then looking at all the neighboring
cells that it could go to. Where it differs from recursive backtracking, however, is how it starts connecting these cells.
In Prim's algorithm, we add all of these cells to a list, and then randomly choose one to make a path to. Then, we iterate this process.
Remember that in our implementation, we are looking at a grid, and we break down walls as we make our maze.

Once again, we list the steps of the algorithm: 


1. Select a random cell to start.
2. Add all unvisited adjacent cells to a list.
3. Choose one of the cells from the list, add it to the maze, and mark it as visited.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all the cells are added to the maze.

Here is a GIF showing the algorithm doing the steps above. White cells represent unvisited cells,
black cells represent walls, and gray cells represent visited cells.

Let's start coding.

## Set Up

The set up for this project is the same as for recursive backtracking. The set up is repeated below in case that you
might have skiped the first part of the series.

### Numpy

Numpy is a very fast Python library used for working with multi-dimensional arrays. If you haven't noticed by now, our
maze is merely a 2d array. To install Numpy, run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

### OpenCV

OpenCV is a library designed mainly for computer-vision and image processing. Since it has very nice pixel-based drawings,
we can use it for our project. To install OpenCV, run the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Code

We begin by importing the libraries into our python code.

```python
import random
import cv2
import numpy as np
```

Now, we will implement a class for Prim's algorithm that will contain all the functions we will need.

```python
class Prims:
	def __init__(self):
		pass
```

The parametrs are the same as before. The width and height of the maze we want to create, the path to save the maze's
image, and a boolean to know whether or not we should display the image after we're done or not.

```python
def __init__(self, height, width, path, display_maze):
	self.width = width
	self.height = height
	self.path = path
	self.display_maze = display_maze
```

The `create_maze` function works as before. It creates a grid with alternating cells and walls. The odd rows or
columns are walls, and the rest are cells. Note that due to simplicity, we once have the outer edge be all cells
and mark them as visited. We will represent every cell with 1, and every wall with 0.

```python
def create_maze(self):
	maze = np.ones((self.height, self.width), dtype=np.float)
	
	for i in range(self.height):
		for j in range(self.width):
			if i%2 == 1 or j %2 == 1:
				maze[i, j] = 0
			if i == 0 or j == 0 or i == self.height - 1 or j == self.width - 1:
				maze[i, j] = 0.5  # visited	
```

We are using 0.5, gray, to denote visited cells.

With our grid done, it is time to implement the algorithm itself. The function `prims` will contain the logic for
the algorithm. The function will recieve two coordinates as the starting point and the grid that we previously
generated.

```python
def prims(x, y, grid):
    grid[y, x] = 0.5  # mark the starting cell as part of the maze
    
    adjacent = set()
    
    if grid[y + 2, x] == 1:
        adjacent.add((y + 2, x))
    if grid[y - 2, x] == 1:
        adjacent.add((y - 2, x))
    if grid[y, x + 2] == 1:
        adjacent.add((y, x + 2))
    if grid[y, x - 2] == 1:
        adjacent.add((y, x - 2))
```

We create an empty set called adjacent. This list will contatin all the possible cells that could be added to the
mazes and are adjacent to the current cell.

Now we will enter a loop. The algorithm finishes when all the cells are added to the maze. In other words, when 
there are no adjacent cells left. So we should exit the loop and finish the algorithm once the set is empty.
Inside the loop, we choose a random cell from the adjacent set and assign the new coordinates to that cell. 

```python
while adjacent:
	cell = random.choice(tuple(adjacent))
	ny = cell[0]
    nx = cell[1]
```

After we choose a cell to go to, we need to carve a passage from it to an existing part of the maze. For this
we will create an empty tuple named `directions`. The `directions` tuple will be filled with possible
directions that the passage could be carved through. 

```python
grid[ny, nx] = 0.5  # mark cell as visited

directions = []

# if the adjacant cells are part of the maze, crave a passage to one of them
if grid[ny + 2, nx] == 0.5:
    directions.append(1)
if grid[ny - 2, nx] == 0.5:
    directions.append(2)
if grid[ny, nx + 2] == 0.5:
    directions.append(3)
if grid[ny, nx - 2] == 0.5:
    directions.append(4)

dir = random.choice(directions)

if dir == 1:
    grid[ny + 1, nx] = 0.5
elif dir == 2:
    grid[ny - 1, nx] = 0.5
elif dir == 3:
    grid[ny, nx + 1] = 0.5
elif dir == 4:
    grid[ny, nx - 1] = 0.5
```

Keep in mind that instead of numbers like 1, 2, 3 and 4 you can use Enums. We used Enums in the last tutorial,
so you can use the same code for this one as well. After we find all the possible directions, we choose one by
random and carve the passage. 

Now we have a new cell and we should find all the adjacent cells to the new one. 

```python
# if the adjacent cells are not part of the maze, add them to the set
if grid[ny + 2, nx] == 1:
    adjacent.add((ny + 2, nx))
if grid[ny - 2, nx] == 1:
    adjacent.add((ny - 2, nx))
if grid[ny, nx + 2] == 1:
    adjacent.add((ny, nx + 2))
if grid[ny, nx - 2] == 1:
    adjacent.add((ny, nx - 2))
```

Lastly, remember that the new cell was at some point an adjacent cell itself. Therefore it needs to be removed from
the list because it clearly cannont be chosen again.

```python
adjacent.remove(cell)  # reomve the cell from the set
```

Now we just need to draw the maze and give it an entrance and display it. This piece of code is identical to what we wrote in the previous tutorial. 

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sx = random.choice(range(2, width - 2, 2))
    sy = random.choice(range(2, height - 2, 2))
    
    prims(sx, sy, maze)
    
    for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
            if not maze[i, j] == 0:
                maze[i, j] = 1
    
    maze[1, 2] = 1
    maze[height - 2, width - 3] = 1
    
    cv2.namedWindow('Maze', cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)
    cv2.imshow('Maze', maze)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## Closing Notes

Prim's algorithm is a quick simple algorithm for implementing maze generation. It gives us insight on how we can bypass
some of the problems we faced when using recursive backtracking, and it shows us how bypassing some of those
problems has affected our final output.

You can find the full code for this algorithm and a few other maze generating algorithms over on my GitHub. I acknowledge
that this is merely a student project, and the code might have certain problems and could definitely be improved upon.
Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
