## Introduction

If you have ever played Minecraft, at some point you have wanted to set up your own server and play with friends. You
might have taken the easy route: port forward your router, download minecraft_server, and run the it.

This method works, however it might not be the best solution for you. What if your network or computer is not powerful to
handle all your friends playing on the server? Then maybe you want to set up a dedicated server.

This guide shows you how to set up a simple minecraft server using AWS EC2 which is going to be very cheap and easy to
handle. 

## Create an EC2 Instance

As mentioned before if we host the server our own personal computer, we'll be facing issues with performance. So it is a
good idea to host it somewhere else. For this guide, we will be hosting our server on the cloud. Hosting the cloud has a
few up sides, the main one being easily scalable.

There are multiple cloud providers out there. The big three are AWS (Amazon), GCP (Google), and Azure (Microsoft). In this
guide we will be using AWS. Create an AWS account and give your payment information.

Our Minecraft server will run on an EC2 instance. An EC2 instance is not a standalone computer that will act as a server.
Rather, it is a virtual machine running on some hardware. This will make it easy for us to scale, and will end up being
cheaper, as we only have to pay for what we use. Keep in mind that if you want to leave the server on for a long time,
then a dedicated server is going to end up being cheaper.

go ahead and start creating an EC2 instance. This will take you to the EC2 dashboard. If you have not created an instance
before, it will prompt you to make one now. Click on launch instance and proceed.

In step 1, choose the **Amazon Linux 2 AMI**. This operating system comes with some useful programs that makes it easier to
use other AWS services, if we choose to do so (read the Closing Notes). Choose the **64-bit (x86)** version and press Select.

In step 2, you have to choose an instance type. You might see that t2.micro is labeled as "Free tier eligible".
You can review AWS's free tier policy here. Choose an instance type that you think is the best for your case. You can
see a list of them with details here. For our server of 6 people, we found t2.xlarge to be a good option, as the smaller
t2s were laggy at times. You might also want to check the M6i and M6g types as well.

<ImgExtra src="/images/aws2.png" alt= "Choosing the EC2's type" width={1000} caption=""/>

After you have chosen your instance type, click on Next: Configure Instance Details and NOT on Review and Launch.
There is nothing to change on this page for our case, so click on Next: Add Storage. Here you can choose your storage type.
The default General Purpose (SSD) is already good and cheap, so click on Next: Add Tags. Again, nothing to change on this
page, so hit Next: Configure Security Group.

Assigning a security group for our instance is like port forwarding for a personal router. You tell the instance who and
what is allowed to communicate with your server, and through what port. Give your security group a name and a description
so you know what it is for later. The existing rule is for SSH connections (we'll talk about SSH later). Click on **Add Rule**
to add a new rule for our Minecraft server. Set the type to **Custom TCP Rule**. Set the port range to **25565**. Finally, 
set the source to **Anywhere**.

<ImgExtra src="/images/aws3.png" alt= "Configuring the EC2's Security Group" width={1000} caption=""/>

Now click Review and Launch. It might take a few moments for your instance to go live.

Go to your EC2 dashboard and confirm that the instance is created. Select the instance you just created to see its detailed.
If it is not already running, go to **Instance state > Start instance**. It'll take a short time for the instance to start.
After the instance is in the start state (you might need to refresh the page to see the change happening), you should be
able to see a public IPv4 address on the details panel. Take note of this IP address as this is what you have to use to
connect to the server. Due to the nature of EC2, this address will change each time the instance is rebooted.

It is time to connect to our instance. One way to do it is to connect using SSH with your terminal. The credentials you
need are on the page. However, we can make our lives easy and just press on the Connect button at the top of the page.
Then in the EC2 Instance Connect tab, press the Connect button. This will create an SSH session with a terminal in our
browser.

Now in our instance environment, we want to create a directory to keep our server related files and folders. Type the
following command:

```bash
cd /
sudo mkdir srv
cd srv
sudo mkdir my-server
```

This will create the path `srv/my-server` at the root directory. You can change the `my-server` directory name to 
whatever you like. Remember that we never log in as root, so you must always use sudo for commands that require any sort
of permissions.

## Get minecraft_server

So far we have the environment to host the server. The next step, similar to when we self-hosted, is to download 
minecraft_server. Since we're in an SSH session with the instance, we must use the console to download the software.

`wget` is a handy program that downloads files from us from the internet. It is fairly simple to use for our case.
The only argument that you must provide is the URL of the file you want to download. Navigate to the 
[minecraft_server page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server), right click on the download link, and copy the URL.

Then at the directory where you are storing the server, run the command below with the URL replaced with what you copied.
At the time of writing this guide, that will be: 

```bash
sudo wget https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/a16d67e5807f57fc4e550299cf20226194497dc2/server.jar
```

## Get Java

Now that we have minecraft_server, we have to run it. The operating system already comes with Java 8. However,
the newer versions of minecraft_server require newer versions of Java. The process of downloading Java is similar to
minecraft_server.

To begin with, create a folder where you will save the java files.

```bash
cd /
sudo mkdir java
cd java
```

Go to [OpenJDK's website](https://openjdk.java.net/), find the version of Java that you want, right click on the
Linux/x64 version, and copy the link. Finally, run the command below with the URL replaced with what you just copied.
At the time of writing this guide, that will be:

```bash
sudo wget https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk16.0.2/d4a915d82b4c4fbb9bde534da945d746/7/GPL/openjdk-16.0.2_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
```

This will download a tar.gz file. To unzip it, run the following command:

```bash
sudo tar -xf openjdk-16.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
```

Note that the name of the compressed file you downloaded might be different and you may need to change the command shown
above.

Now that we have Java installed, we want to be able to call the command and use it. Note that since we are going to use 
`sudo`, we can skip adding the command to `PATH` environment variable and add it directly to the `sudo` path. To do that, 
run the command:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

This will start a `vim` session with the sudo config file. If you have not used vim before, take the time now to learn how
you can edit and save documents using it. Edit the file by adding the Java bin path to the end of `secure_path`. 
In our case that would be:

```bash
secure_path="...:/java/jdk-16.0.1"
```

## Run Server

Now that we have everything set up, we can run the server. Go the the directory where you saved minecraft_server and run
the command to boot up minecraft_server:

```bash
sudo java -Xmx8G -jar server.jar nogui
```

Make sure that the amount of RAM you are specifying is no more than what your EC2 instance has to offer. If this is the
first time you are running the server, then you must edit the eula.txt (using vim or any other console text editor of your
choice) and change the final line to:

```
eula=true
```

Then just run the server again and you should be able to edit the server properties. From now own, simply navigate to
this directory, and run the server. Your friends should be able to join the server by simply typing the public IPv4
address of the instance (found on the instance dashboard) into the direct connect section. Note that the public IPv4
address changes each time the instance is rebooted.

## Closing Notes

This guide showed you how you can host a Minecraft sever yourself on an AWS EC2 instance. This way of hosting has many
advantages. If you ever feel like you need a more powerful server, you can upgrade the server just by a few clicks by
going to Actions > Instance Settings > Change instance type (There are certain requirements that are outlined in the 
[EC2 documentations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html)).

You can also use all the other AWS services such as S3 for automatic backups or AWS Lambda for automatic boot up.

Again, keep in mind that this is not a dedicated server. If you leave the server to be up for 24 hours for multiple days,
your bill will have some not so good looking numbers on it. So make sure you stop the instance after each play session.

*Have fun playing Minecraft*.
